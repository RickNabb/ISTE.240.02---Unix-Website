               Initially, the Massachussets Institute of Technology and AT&T Bell Labs were conducting a research initiative to develop and experimental time sharing operating system. This system was called "Multics" and would be used for GE's mainframe. Through its many innovations, Multics also surfaced many problems. Out of frustration from the project not gaining traction and not having enough focus, Bell Labs pulled from the project slowly but surely. The last researchers from Bell Labs to leave the Multics project, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna, decided to being working on their own project that was very similar to Multics but on a much smaller scale.

               Unix dates back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AT&T Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing an experimental time sharing operating system called Multics for the GE-645 mainframe.[8] Multics introduced many innovations, but had many problems. Bell Labs, frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics but not the aims, slowly pulled out of the project. Their last researchers to leave Multics, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna,[9] decided to redo the work on a much smaller scale. In 1970, Peter Neumann coined the project name Unics (UNiplexed Information and Computing Service) as a pun on Multics, (Multiplexed Information and Computer Services).[10] Eventually, Unics supported multiple simultaneous users, and it was renamed Unix.
                The first commercial instance of Unix was installed in early 1972 at New York Telephone Co. Systems Development Center, under the direction of Dan Gielan. In 1972, Unix was rewritten in the C programming language.[11] The migration from assembly to the higher-level language C, resulted in much more portable software, requiring only a relatively small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms.
                In 1975, UNIX was first licensed to an outside institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, by Greg Chesson and Donald B. Gillies.[citation needed]
                During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (particularly of the BSD variant, originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by commercial startups, the most notable of which are Sequent, HP-UX, Solaris, and AIX, Xenix, as well as Darwin, which forms the core set of components upon which Apple's OS X and iOS are based.[12][13]
