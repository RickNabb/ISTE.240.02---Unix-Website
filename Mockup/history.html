            <h2>The History of Unix</h2>
            <h4 class="clear25">Multics</h4>
            <p>
               Initially, the Massachussets Institute of Technology and AT&T Bell Labs were conducting a research initiative to develop and experimental time sharing operating system. This system was called "Multics" and would be used for GE's mainframe. Through its many innovations, Multics also surfaced many problems. Out of frustration from the project not gaining traction and not having enough focus, Bell Labs pulled from the project slowly but surely. The last researchers from Bell Labs to leave the Multics project, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, M. D. McIlroy, and J. F. Ossanna, decided to being working on their own project that was very similar to Multics but on a much smaller scale.

            <h4 class='clear25'>Unics</h4>
            <p>
               Peter Neumann in the year 1970 first coined the project name as UNiPlexed Information and Computing Service, shortened as Unics. This was intended to be a pun on the previous system they worked on, Multics, which conversely stood for Multiplexed Information and Computer Services. In eventuality, the Unic system began supporting multiple numbers of users simultanously, and thus the name was changed to be Unix.

           <h4 class='clear25'>Unix</h4>
           <p>
               In the commercial market, Unix first came into existence early in the year 1972. Ney York Telephone Co. Systems Development Center, via control of Dan Gielan, put it on the market. That same year it was rewritten from the original programming language of Assembly to the C programming langauge. This switch allowed for software to be created that was much more portable since C is a much higher-level language than Assembly. The code only required a small amount of machine-dependent code to be replaced when porting Unix to other computing platforms when compared to the amount of machine-dependent code that was needed when Unix was written in Assembly. Three years later, in 1975, for the first time in its history UNIX was licensed to an outside institution, the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, by Greg Chesson and Donald B. Gillies. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Unix had

                During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (particularly of the BSD variant, originating from the University of California, Berkeley) by commercial startups, the most notable of which are Sequent, HP-UX, Solaris, and AIX, Xenix, as well as Darwin, which forms the core set of components upon which Apple's OS X and iOS are based.[12][13]
